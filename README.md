# Mousal-Command

This is my 1992 port of my 1980 Z80 assembler Missile Command (also here on github)
to the Windows 3.1 platform using Borland C++ 4.5.

I tried this in a Windows 3.1 VM using my old Borland C++ 4.5 CDs and it works.

It has sound effects and runs at arcade speed.

At the time I wrote it as an exercise to see how much faster I could write it in the C language.  
The answer is the 1980 Z80 version took about 3 months and the 1992 C version took about 2 weeks.

The 1992 version has a rather smart demo mode, which the 1980 version did not have.
